## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Sign up for these free services:
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) - Serverless hosting
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/signup) - Inbound email receiving (unlimited free)
- [Resend](https://resend.com/signup) - Outbound email sending (100 emails/day free)
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/signup) - Claude API
- [Upstash](https://upstash.com/signup) - Redis (10K requests/day free)

You'll also need a domain for your agent email address (e.g., `alert@inbound.yourdomain.com`).

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd g0t-phish

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your API keys:
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (from console.anthropic.com)
# - RESEND_API_KEY (from resend.com/api-keys)
# - RESEND_AGENT_EMAIL (your agent email address)
# - UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL (from console.upstash.com)
# - UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN (from console.upstash.com)
```

### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login and deploy
vercel login
vercel --prod

# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables ‚Üí Add all from .env.local
```

### Configure Email Services

#### SendGrid (Inbound - Receiving Emails)

1. **Create SendGrid account** at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com/signup)
2. **Authenticate domain** - Add DNS records for SPF, DKIM
3. **Configure MX records** for your subdomain:
   ```
   Type: MX
   Host: inbound
   Priority: 10
   Value: mx.sendgrid.net
   ```
4. **Setup Inbound Parse Webhook**:
   - Domain: `yourdomain.com`
   - Subdomain: `inbound` (creates `alert@inbound.yourdomain.com`)
   - Webhook URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/inbound`
   - Enable spam check ‚úÖ

**See [SENDGRID_SETUP.md](./SENDGRID_SETUP.md) for detailed configuration guide.**

#### Resend (Outbound - Sending Reports)

1. **Add your domain** at [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. **Add DNS records** for sending authentication (SPF, DKIM)
3. **No inbound configuration needed** - SendGrid handles receiving

**Test**: Send an email to `alert@inbound.yourdomain.com`!

## Usage

### Analyze a Suspicious Email

Forward any suspicious email to your configured agent address:

```
To: alert@inbound.yourdomain.com
Subject: Can you check this suspicious email?
```

### Receive Analysis Report

Within 2-3 seconds, you'll receive an HTML email containing:

- **Verdict**: Safe ‚úÖ / Suspicious ‚ö†Ô∏è / Phishing üö®
- **Confidence Score**: 0-100% confidence level
- **Threat Details**: Specific findings with severity and evidence
- **Authentication Status**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC results
- **AI Summary**: Human-readable explanation

---

## Example Analysis

**Input:** Email claiming urgent account verification from "PayPal"

**Output Report:**
```
üö® PHISHING DETECTED - Confidence: 87%

Threats Identified:
‚Ä¢ [CRITICAL] Sender spoofing: Email claims PayPal but from @paypa1.net
‚Ä¢ [HIGH] Malicious link: URL redirects to credential harvesting site
‚Ä¢ [MEDIUM] Urgency manipulation: "Verify within 24 hours or account suspended"

Authentication:
‚Ä¢ SPF: FAIL ‚ùå
‚Ä¢ DKIM: NONE ‚ùå
‚Ä¢ DMARC: FAIL ‚ùå

Summary: This email is a phishing attempt impersonating PayPal. The sender
domain is fake, authentication checks fail, and the link leads to a
credential harvesting page. Do not click any links or provide information.
